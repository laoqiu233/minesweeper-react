I tried making this project as authentic as possible by using old school fonts and classic Win98 icons, 
replicating the style of Win98 with CSS.

Stuff used for this project:
- TypeScript
- Webpack
- React
- Redux
- React Router

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
